**Introduction To Asynchronous Programming in JavaScript**

In general JavaScript is running code in a non-blocking way. This means that code which is is taking some time to finish (like accessing an API, reading content from the local file system etc.) is being executed in the background and in parallel the code execution is continued. This behaviour is being described by term asynchronous programming.
