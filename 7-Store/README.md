**What is React State Management?**

React components have a built-in state object. The state is encapsulated data where you store assets that are persistent between component renderings.

The state is just a fancy term for a JavaScript data structure. If a user changes state by interacting with your application, the UI may look completely different afterwards, because it's represented by this new state rather than the old state.

**Why do you need React state management?**

React applications are built using components and they manage their state internally and it works well for applications with few components, but when the application grows bigger, the complexity of managing states shared across components becomes difficult.

Here is a simple example of an e-commerce application, in which the status of multiple components will change when purchasing a product.

- Add that product to the shopping list
- Add product to customer history
- trigger count of purchased products

If developers do not have scalability in mind then it is really hard to find out what is happening when something goes wrong. This is why you need state management in your application.

Letâ€™s discuss how to use react state management using react hooks
