**What is React State Management?**

React components have a built-in state object. The state is encapsulated data where you store assets that are persistent between component renderings.

The state is just a fancy term for a JavaScript data structure. If a user changes state by interacting with your application, the UI may look completely different afterwards, because it's represented by this new state rather than the old state.

**Why do you need React state management?**

React applications are built using components and they manage their state internally and it works well for applications with few components, but when the application grows bigger, the complexity of managing states shared across components becomes difficult.
