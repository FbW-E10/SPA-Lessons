**What are components?**

Components are the building blocks of any React app and a typical React app will have many of these. Simply put, a component is a JavaScript class or function that optionally accepts inputs i.e. properties(props) and returns a React element that describes how a section of the UI (User Interface) should appear.

**Your first component**

```JS
 const Greeting = () => <h1>Hello World today!</h1>;
```

This is a functional component (called Greeting) written using ES6’s arrow function syntax that takes no props and returns an H1 tag with the text “Hello World today!”
